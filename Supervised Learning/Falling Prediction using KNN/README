k-Nearest-Neighbors (k-NN) 

k-Nearest-Neighbors (k-NN) is a supervised machine learning model. Supervised learning is when a model 
learns from data that is already labeled. A supervised learning model takes in a set of input objects and 
output values. The model then trains on that data to learn how to map the inputs to the desired output so it can learn to make 
predictions on unseen data.
